As the seas rose and the rivers flooded, crops failed and unrest threatened to tear the United States apart politically. No single government body could step in and help coordinate the crisis. But a new engineering firm specializing in ecological risk mitigation made the US government an option: Let us fix your problem, or get your money back. The Trans-Mississippi Recovery Initiative was given over to the American Reclamation Corporation, from the first shovel in the dirt to the ongoing crop cycling in the Midwest. No one can argue with the results - dust storms no longer rock Tennessee, for example - and the ARC is the biggest thing in America these days. Employing a full 23% of the population, with perhaps as much as 85% of the US relying on the ARC for their business, the business of America is the business of the ARC."

Given its material advantages and the pressure from a large population with limited land, PAC took a leading role in the colonization effort, building a space station under the auspices of its Manned Space Engineering Office that would serve as the prototype for the first orbital colony ship spacedocks. Just one decade later, a Chinese crew made the first manned landing on Mars, following mapping by the Yinghou satellite network. Although given urgency by the discovery of the Inflection Point, the establishment of viable and self-sufficient settlements on alien worlds had always been a goal of the PAC Space Agency. In the years following, multiple PAC missions scattered in various directions into the galaxy, with as yet unknown results."

Led by some of the original COMESA founding states, the revamped “People’s” African Union was formed.

COMESA involvement in the new Africa eventually turned to tapping its prodigious natural and agricultural resources, while attempting to maintain its ecological diversity and heritage through extensive wildlife parks and natural wonders. Funded projects included dams, new energy sources such as wind-farms, and coastal and Congolese reclamation efforts. The African Common Market also invested heavily in education for the post-Mistake generations and in humanitarian projects, notably in the realms of health care and human rights. New industries were pursued, and the Union became one of the major players in international trade. But problems remain, although the People’s African Union continues to implement policies to address these.

While it may be facile to claim that it takes a village to raise a child, it may be said with certainty that it takes a village to survive as a colony on a distant world. The attitude of the African colonial administration is best summed up by the unofficial motto of the People’s African Union, the ancient Bondei proverb that says, “Sticks in a bundle are unbreakable.”"

The Directorate-General for Education and Culture was aggressive in promoting and exporting European cultural works – especially through the media – to the rest of the world. For Franco-Iberians, their shared cultural history and the cultural infusion from North Africa has become a source of unifying pride. With such initiatives and stability, it is unsurprising that others sought to join Franco-Iberia in the face of a confusing and threatening world.

Algiers' new port bustles day and night with a new class of low-energy cargo ships. Tunis is a shimmering resort city to the world, whose nightclubs and cafes thrum with the sound of a new generation of musicians.
