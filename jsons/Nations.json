As the seas rose and the rivers flooded, crops failed and unrest threatened to tear the United States apart politically. No single government body could step in and help coordinate the crisis. But a new engineering firm specializing in ecological risk mitigation made the US government an option: Let us fix your problem, or get your money back. The Trans-Mississippi Recovery Initiative was given over to the American Reclamation Corporation, from the first shovel in the dirt to the ongoing crop cycling in the Midwest. No one can argue with the results - dust storms no longer rock Tennessee, for example - and the ARC is the biggest thing in America these days. Employing a full 23% of the population, with perhaps as much as 85% of the US relying on the ARC for their business, the business of America is the business of the ARC."

Its entertainment division consolidated most of the old entertainment brands decades ago, and streams ARC-funded entertainment over ARC satellite or through ARC-laid cable to the rest of the world.

Central Asia was swept up by the chaos as other nations in the region faced outbreaks of violence; surrounding powers such as India and Russia mobilized their forces in fear that the conflict would embroil their populations.

In the cities, the academic establishment focused their best efforts and talents on applied sciences and trade skills, and within a generation PAC students were throwing back the boundaries of theoretical physics, chemical engineering, computer science and advanced fabrication. Given its material advantages and the pressure from a large population with limited land, PAC took a leading role in the colonization effort, building a space station under the auspices of its Manned Space Engineering Office that would serve as the prototype for the first orbital colony ship spacedocks. Just one decade later, a Chinese crew made the first manned landing on Mars, following mapping by the Yinghou satellite network. Although given urgency by the discovery of the Inflection Point, the establishment of viable and self-sufficient settlements on alien worlds had always been a goal of the PAC Space Agency. In the years following, multiple PAC missions scattered in various directions into the galaxy, with as yet unknown results."
